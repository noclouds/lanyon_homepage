NoClouds was founded to give the Internet back to people who use it:

* Publishers and small companies that need to maintain immutable and incorruptible content and data control over distributed networks.
* The general public, who rely on email, and p2p communication services, texting, video chat, social networking and personal broadcasting services.

NoClouds was founded in Israel in August, 2019.
